## Lab Overview

In this lab we will explore End-User Monitoring (EUM), or Real-User Monitoring (RUM) for the robot shop application. Instana supports website monitoring by analyzing actual browser request and loading times. It allows detailed insights into the web browsing experience of users, and deep visibility into application call paths. At the end of this lab, you will be able to analyse website monitoring for the sample application.

## Step 1: 

Click Websites & Mobile Apps from left navigation.
