## Lab Overview

Synthetic monitoring is a proactive approach to monitoring the performance and functionality of applications, websites, and APIs. It involves simulating real user interactions and measuring how the system responds. This allows you to identify and fix issues before they impact real users.
This lab focuses on  Instana feature - Synthetic Monitoring.
Key capabilities that we will do are:
1.Setting up the synthetic "Point of Presence" This is the component that executes the synthetic test.
2.Test Availability of your website using API Simple Test 

Before we can create any synthetic tests, we must first setup a synthetic "Point of Presence" or "PoP server" to playback our synthetic tests. Many customers deploy two or more "Points of Presence" so that they can compare the response time and availability from different network zones . 
In the lab, we will begin by installing the "Synthetic Point of Presence". 

## Step 1: 

Install Synthetic Point of Presence component

Pre-requisite 
Synthetic PoP needs to be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. Use the helm chart to deploy Synthetic PoP.
  
The minimum supported version for the Kubernetes distribution is 1.10  . Install Helm, and Helm V3 is recommended

##Note : 
We will be installing the Synthetic Point of Presence into  Kubernetes Cluster provided in the POT / Sandbox  
Instructor will guide you with this process 

Make sure you are logged into the server where Kubernetes Cluster is installed Master/Worker Node 

**Helm**

If Helm wasn't installed during previous labs, install it on Student VM( bastion node) now with command:

curl (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3)

Click on "Synthetic Monitoring" and then on "Deploy a PoP" button:

![Lab 14](../Labs/images/lab14.1.png) 

Use Simple tab for Helm command
![Lab 14](../Labs/images/lab14.2.png) 

You will need to edit the information contained in the helm command, so copy and paste the text to edit the file and execute accordingly.
Helm install synthetic-pop \
	--repo "https://agents.instana.io/helm" \
	--namespace syn \
	--create-namespace \
	--set downloadKey="xxx" \
	--set controller.location="MyPop;RoksDK;India;Blr;0;0;This is a Synthetic PoP Testing" \
	--set controller.clusterName="cp4i" \
    --set controller.instanaKey="xxx" \
	--set controller.instanaSyntheticEndpoint="https://synthetics-xxx-saas.instana.io" \
	--set redis.tls.enabled=false \
	--set redis.password="a1fc5d01bcbb" \
    --set seccompDefault=true \  
	synthetic-pop

The default helm command will look as  above Some of the parameters have been replace with "xxx" for security reasons.
For Synthetic Point of Presence we need to modify some of the parameters and provide one additional parameter. 
•	Add --set seccompDefault=true \. This parameter is required for OpenShift versions 4.11 and above
•	Then, modify the controller.clusterName parameter and provide a meaningful name.
•	In the controller.location, specify a name, display name, country, etc. for your "Point of Presence". 

Copy the helm command from the text file and paste it into a terminal window on the Student VM(Bastion node). This will execute the helm chart.
You should see an output similar to the following:

[user@bastion ~]$ helm install synthetic-pop \
>     --repo https://agents.instana.io/helm  \
>     --namespace syn\
>     --create-namespace \
>     --set downloadKey="xxx" \
>     --set controller.location=" MyPop;RoksDK;India;Blr;0;0;This is a Synthetic PoP Testing" \
>     --set controller.instanaKey="xxx" \
>     --set controller.clusterName="cp4i" \
>     --set controller.instanaSyntheticEndpoint=" https://synthetics-xxx-saas.instana.io " \
>     --set redis.tls.enabled=false \
>     --set redis.password="a1fc5d01bcbb" \
>     --set seccompDefault=true \
>     synthetic-pop
NAME: synthetic-pop
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Jul 13 07:49:37 2023
NAMESPACE: syn
STATUS: deployed

Verify Installation 
After the Synthetic point of presence is installed verify its appearance in the interface:
![Lab 14](../Labs/images/lab14.3.png) 

You can also confirm that the Synthetic Point of Presence is running by typing:
 get pods -n syn-space  ( Syn is a namespace) 

## Step 2: 

Rest API Synthetic Tests 
Let's begin by executing a simple REST API test. This will be a single REST GET request.
Begin by selecting Synthetics and then + ADD as seen below.
![Lab 14](../Labs/images/lab14.4.png) 

Then, click the Add Synthetic Test button.
![Lab 14](../Labs/images/lab14.5.png) 

you will see that you have the option of an API Simple test or an API Script test. Leave the default of API Simple and click the Next button.
![Lab 14](../Labs/images/lab14.6.png) 

A new dialog will open prompting for the REST API GET URL. Enter the following URL:
 http://x.x.x.x:8080/  ( This is the ip address / hostname which you need to test )
 
This could be any REST request. In this case, we are testing the  API call within the Robot Shop application.

Then, select your Point of Presence location and click Next. This allows you to choose the location(s) where you want your synthetic script to execute. In the lab, you only have 1 location that you can select. 
![Lab 14](../Labs/images/lab14.7.png) 

The next screen allows you to specify the scheduling interval for your synthetic test. Drag the time slider to 1 minute. Then, select Next
![Lab 14](../Labs/images/lab14.8.png) 

On the next screen you will give your syntetic test a name and description. Then, optionally, associate the synthetic test with an application. 
Finally, click the Create button to finish creating your synthetic test.
![Lab 14](../Labs/images/lab14.9.png) 

On the next Screen , select Tests Tab 
Click on the RoboShop Test  link to drill down into the details of the synthetic test.
It will take a couple of minutes for the synthetic tests to begin executing.
![Lab 14](../Labs/images/lab14.10.png) 

On the screen, you can see a summary of the synthetic results. You can also click on the Results tab and see the detailed results of each synthetic test.

You have now successfully created a synthetic test against a single REST API
